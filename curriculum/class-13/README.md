# Updating and Deleting Resources

## Overview

Today we will discuss how to send DELETE and PUT requests with an HTML5 form. We introduce the ability to update or delete a book from the collection through a form, using the middleware `method-override` on the server.

## Daily Plan

- Warm-up exercise
- Review code challenges
- Introduction of today's code challenge topic
- Code review of lab assignment
- Middleware: `method-override`
- Deleting a resource
- Updating a resource
- Code Demo
- Lab Preview

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing lecture 13 of Code 301, students will:

- Be able to send a post request and route it as a put or delete using method-override
- Update or delete records stored in the database

## Outline

### Feedback Review

#### The Good

- Lectures have been preparing us well for labs
- Lectures seem to be tying some things together that weren't previously connecting for us
- Trello is awesome, it really spells it out

#### The Bad

- The official instructor switch was a bit jarring
- John is FAST
- Concerns around John's availability in project week
- Want more student code reviews
  - This is coming!
  - I had a sense that we needed to shore up some fundamentals and that takes time

#### The Ugly

- Trello sucks, I don't know where to start
- That final is looming ... and I totally forget jQuery and Handlebars!
