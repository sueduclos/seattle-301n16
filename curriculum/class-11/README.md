# Server-side templating with EJS

## Overview

Today is the first day of our new project, a mobile-only book collection. You will be working with the same partner(s) each day, gradually working towards a full-scale application, complete with server-side templating, persistence in a SQL database, and the ability to search the Google Books API for new books to add to your collection.

## Daily Plan

- Warm-up exercise
- Review code challenges
- Introduction of today's code challenge topic
- Full-stack application skeleton scaffolding
- HTML5 Forms
- Server-side templating
- Google Books API
- Code Demo
- Lab Preview

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing lecture 11 of Code 301, students will:

- Understand how to architect a full-stack web application
- Create a schema to model data
- Interact with the Google Books API to search for books based on user queries
- Display API results to the user, hiding certain details for a smooth user experience
- Be able to dynamically render information to the user through the use of a server-side templating library

## Feedback Survey Thoughts and Trends

- More time with the TAs wanted
  - TAs were a big help, but are pretty busy
- Switching of instructor styles was definitely noticed
  - Disruptive of Rhythm
  - But good get a nice summary of the week
- Overall lecture structure
  - Preparedness
  - Debugging
  - Repeating of code was seen as good and bad
  - "I found lectures not especially helpful as I tend to find other resources to help me out"
    - ^ Good and Bad
- Some concerns about the final and being ready for 401
- Mixed feelings on pair programming
  - "I can see the value of it, but it doesn't work for me" (huh?)
- More rubric insights, grading solidarity, inline feedback wanted
- Monitors in the co-working space!
